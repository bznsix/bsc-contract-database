 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

    Welcome to LILO!
    
    LILO is a community-driven, fair-launched DeFi Token powered by the Binance Smart Chain.
    Deflation comes from the other LiqLock protocol apps such as LiqLockV1 that burn part of its own earned tokens.
    
    LILO is the first token to implement the LiqLock protocol.
    LiqLock is a decentralized protocol that lets you lock your liquidity.
    LiqLock is a community-driven project and we welcome any feedback or suggestions.
